# Catch-up ECMAScript2015(ES6)
I caught up ES5 in [the repository](https://github.com/Nismit/catch-up-es5). In this repository, I picked up some of features of ES6 with sample code.
Personally, ES6 has implemented so many features, so it was tough little bit to understand for them.
I guess, my sample code have bugs or wrong(of course, I run a test all of them).
Please let me know, if you found wrong syntax or bugs!
Thanks in advance!
